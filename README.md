# krail-testApp

A functional test application for [krail](https://github.com/davidsowerby/krail)

This application is intended for functional testing but also provides a reasonable demonstration of site navigation,  notifications, very simple authentication, push and internationalisation.

The [documentation](http://krail.readthedocs.io/en/master/) provides more information about [Krail](https://github.com/davidsowerby/krail)

You won't be able to run the tests themselves unless you have a licence for Vaadin Testbench

## Test Environment and execution

The host requires some preparation. See [notes](https://github.com/davidsowerby/krail-testApp/wiki/Test-Environment) for what is required

Tests could also run on top of docker containers with `integrationTestTomcat7` or `integrationTestTomcat8` gradle tasks.
