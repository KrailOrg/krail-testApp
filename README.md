# Krail Test Application

[Krail](https://github.com/davidsowerby/krail) (previously known as V7) provides a framework for rapid Java web development by combining Vaadin, Guice, Apache Shiro, Apache configuration and others.

This application is intended for functional testing but also provides a reasonable demonstration of site navigation,  notifications, very simple authentication, push and internationalisation.

The [documentation](https://sites.google.com/site/q3cjava/home) and [blog](http://rndjava.blogspot.co.uk/) provide more information about [Krail](https://github.com/davidsowerby/krail)
