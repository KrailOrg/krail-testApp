The renaming of the war file has been removed from build.gradle, including it caused errors.Â  File is now renamed as part of Dockerfile.
Subsequently realised that war renaming is fine, just needs IDEA to use the exploded war, or to set up build paths for exploded/standard war correctly in IDEA

UITestServlet removed, it was causing an Atmosphere warnings about duplicate Endpoints

@Ignore two intermittent test failures, see #11 and #15
